"""
Internal Medicine — Model Health Monitoring System.

Unified API for monitoring model health during training across backends:
- Megatron-Bridge (PyTorch)
- PaddleFleet (PaddlePaddle)

Monitors:
- qk_stats: Attention QK statistics (entropy, max logits, sink weights)
- moe_health: MoE health metrics (router, experts, tokens, shared)
- ple_health: Per-Layer Embedding health (Megatron only)

Usage:
    from internal_medicine import setup_internal_medicine, training_logs

    monitor_dict = {}
    model = setup_internal_medicine(
        model,
        monitors=['qk_stats', 'moe_health'],
        monitor_dict=monitor_dict,
    )

    # In train_step wrapper
    for monitor in monitor_dict.values():
        monitor.step()

    # Read metrics
    metrics = training_logs.gather_and_aggregate()

    Unified setup function for all internal medicine monitors.

    Args:
        model: Model or list of models to monitor
        monitors: List of monitor names. Options:
            - 'qk_stats': QK attention statistics
            - 'moe_health': MoE health metrics
            - 'ple_health': PLE health (Megatron only)
            - 'massive_act': Massive activation metrics
            - 'all': Enable all available monitors. None defaults to all.
        monitor_dict: Dict to store monitor instances
        monitor_interval: Steps between monitoring
        verbose: Print debug information
        backend: Force a specific backend ('megatron' or 'paddlefleet').
            Auto-detected if None.
        hook_timing_enabled: Enable lightweight per-hook CPU wall-time diagnostics
            for backends that support it.
        **kwargs: Per-monitor kwargs, keyed by monitor name.
            e.g. qk_stats={'causal': True}

    Returns:
        model (unchanged, monitors are registered via hooks)
